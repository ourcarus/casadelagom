### Food review for Fluff Stack

Today we tried Fluff Stack at Tampines One. 

Goofy ordered the hazelnut chocolate while Stitch ordered her favourite peanut butter stack and the new found love - kokoa drink.

A reminder to bring water for Goofy for such desserty and palette-heavy meals in the future.
