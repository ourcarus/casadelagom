Today we tried Fluff Stack at Tampines One. 

Goofy ordered the hazelnut chocolate while Stitch ordered her favourite peanut butter stack and the new found love - kokoa drink.

<u>Cost</u>

| Hazelnut chocolate pancake | $14.50 |
| Peanut butter pancake | $14 |
| Kokoa drink | $5 |
| Total | $33.50 |

A reminder to bring water for Goofy for such desserty and palette-heavy meals in the future.
