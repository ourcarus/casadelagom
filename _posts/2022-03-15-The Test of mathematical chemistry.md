### The next phase: Test of mathematical chemistry

Writing this to keep as a memory, the events that happened on 11 Mar 2022.

### Background
Originally wanted to have an overseas proposal but not feasible and practical due to the ongoing pandemic and the timings.

I remember we booked the staycation at Carlton via Klook on 31 Dec 2021 using the SRV vouchers that was expiring. At that point in time, i didn't thought of using this staycation as an opportunity.

It wasn't really a surprise since Stitch chose her own ring. We went down to JP on 29 Jan 2021 to view the diamond and ring setting. Upsized about 1.5 for the ring size. Then, i went down myself to collect the ring on 28 Feb 2022. The entire process from education to selection, customisation, viewing and collection took about 7 months.

- 3 Jul 2021: Diamond education session with a diamond specialist
- 21 Aug 2021: Order Custom Cut Decagon 10 Hearts & Arrows (LG)
- 9 Sep 2021: Confirmation of ring design based on 3D Render V5
- 29 Jan 2022: Diamond viewing
- 28 Feb 2022: Ring collection
- 11 Mar 2022: The test

### Preparation
Received helpful props from future BIL and sister and was originally planning to craft a scrapbook for the proposal but it seems that time wasn't enough and discipline was not good. Instead, decorated a corkboard and stringed up some printed photos from our trips over the years. Ordered a letter board from TB which was supposed to be black but it came in grey.

Research on the flower bouquet was done via instagram. There were numerous flower bouquet shops and it did not take very long to finalise and select one that i think Stitch will love. When i saw it, i knew it instantly that Stitch will love it. Had to bring the props to office the previous day on 10 Mar 2022 and deposit at the hotel after work.

### Execution
On the actual day, we went to Tai Seng to queue for 1 hr to eat our beloved fish soup. Check in was at 3pm and we arrived around 2.40pm to see a long queue. Told Stitch to sit at the lounge area while i queue up to check in so that i can use the opportunity to prepare the room. While queuing, i saw our bouquet being delivered to the receptionist and i was hoping Stitch wouldn't notice. After checking in, i sprang to unpack the props and decorate the room before leaving and meeting Stitch downstairs, hoping that she hadn't sus anything yet. It was cool to be able to draw the curtain so that the fairy lights can come into play nicely.

When Stitch got in, i gave her the bouquet and asked her to decode the numbers on it with 3 layers of encoding. After numerous hints, and with utmost faith in her, she finally decoded the message and i proposed to her and put on the ring for her.

### Dinner
We had dinner at 1826, coincidental that the restaurant happened to be numbers as well. The restaurant screwed up the reservation timing as they had our booking at 8.30pm instead of 7.30 which was what we booked. However the manager was nice and offered us a free beer (which was wasted) and a free lava cake. Stitch ordered lobster and i ordered pork ribs.
