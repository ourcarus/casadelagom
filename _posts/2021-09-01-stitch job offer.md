### Job offer for Stitch after 646 days at Txxx-x

Stitch got an official job offer from Pxxxxxxx but the base salary seems low and now the struggle is whether to accept/negotiate or reject the offer...

Happy for Stitch.

Stitch got another offer from P***** but already negotiated with Pxxxxxxx on the salary. Stitch is in a dilemma and Goofy bought an avocado coconut shake for her to celebrate the double offer!


Stitch even forgot the heater for the first time.

Happy for Stitch x2.
