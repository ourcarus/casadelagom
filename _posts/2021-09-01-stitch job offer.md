### Job offer for Stitch after 646 days at Txxx-x

Stitch got an official job offer from Pxxxxxxx but the base salary seems low and now the struggle is whether to accept/negotiate or reject the offer...

Happy for Stitch.

### Update on 7 Sep 2021

Stitch got another offer from P***** but already negotiated with Pxxxxxxx on the salary. Stitch is in a dilemma and Goofy bought an avocado coconut shake for her to celebrate the double offer!


Stitch even forgot the heater for the first time.

Happy for Stitch x2.

### Update on 9 Sep 2021

Stitch has decided to accept P***** and Goofy had a small pay increment! We also received our EHG grant approval today. Happy day for us both. Though a bit sad that Stitch seem to have forgotten about this as focus was on her job offer.

### Update on 22 Sep 2021
Stitch is certified fit for enployment at new P***** and officially resigned from the old job. Happy for stitch.
