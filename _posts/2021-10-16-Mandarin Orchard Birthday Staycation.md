### Mandarin Orchard Birthday Staycation

We checked in on 14 Oct 2021 and Goofy requested for a complimentary cake and free room upgrade. We got a free room upgrade from deluxe to superior deluxe and a complimentary chocolate cake sent to our room.

Wanted to book pool but pool was full so we booked for 7am the next morning.

Went out to get lush and got a free bath bomb as part of lush's good will.

Brought stitch to dinner at FIRE restaurant, back at ION sky after 5 years when we were at Salt Grill and Sky Bar for stitch's 21st birthday.
