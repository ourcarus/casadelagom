### [STITCH's BDAY] @ Mandarin Orchard 

We checked in on 14 Oct 2021 and Goofy requested for a complimentary cake and free room upgrade. We got a free room upgrade from deluxe to superior deluxe and a complimentary chocolate cake sent to our room.

Wanted to book pool but pool was full so we booked for 7am the next morning.

Went out to get lush and got a free bath bomb as part of lush's good will.

Brought stitch to dinner at FIRE restaurant, back at ION sky after 5 years when we were at Salt Grill and Sky Bar for stitch's 21st birthday.

The waiter asked if we wanted still or sparkling water to start off and we chose still and got an evian bottle of water costing $10.

We were served one small bread with a plate of butter to start the meal. And goofy mistaken that plate of butter as cheese. HAHAHAHAH. The bread was warm, it was crispy on the outside yet soft on the inside. It was delicious! 10/10.

We ordered a cheese platter ($28) which we needed to choose 2 out of 3 cheeses available - soft, hard and blue. We went with the recommended soft and hard and stitch didnt like the soft cheese due to the smell. Goofy didnt enjoy the whole cheese platter except the crackers. There could have been more plain crackers to go with the cheese. 2/10.

Stitch ordered pork ribs while Goofy ordered snapper as their mains. Both the mains looked and taste fantastic. 10/10. Fun fact: Goofy guessed beforehand what stitch would order, and Goofy was right!:)

Lastly, we ordered a plate of Flan as our dessert. It was later served as a "birthday cake" for stitch. It was prettily presented but it was tooo sweet. 6/10. The restaurant later waived this dessert off our bill as the kitchen took too long to prepare our dessert.
