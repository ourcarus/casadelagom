### Enroute to decluttering, more organised and a lagom lifestyle

We packed and cleaned C's room as we had bought an ikea KALLAX shelf to replace her old small light grey cabinet, infested with cockroaches. 

R: Also bought a new pillow from Akemi for my room and pending slippers as my havaianas from Bali just broke recently.

Celebrated C's father bday, ordering dinner from guma and salted caramel cake from bob. first time peeling so much crab for C as her hand was injured due to a work accident.

Was a pity didn't get to drink the green bean soup.
