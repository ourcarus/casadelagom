### Deciding on diamond and band design

We made an appointment on 21 Aug 2021 for our second trip to Jann Paul.

During this appointment, we decided on the diamond. We have decided to go with a Lab grown decagon diamond with a carat size between 0.56 to 0.59. The price range for this diamond is $2000 - $2200. The actual carat size and price will only be confirmed after JP received the diamonds and assign one to us that is within our budget and our criteria. Currently, the criteria of the lab grown diamond is type IIa, colour D-F, clarity of VVS1-VVS2. 

For the band design, Stitch has decided to go with 1.5mm bandwith 18K white gold rounded band, with no crown, no heart shape tray and with 2 side diamonds on each side. Band size 49. 

The 3D design of the ring will be done up by JP and will be sent to us in about a week's time. So exciting! The current total estimate of the ring is about $3000. Well within our budget that we have set for the engagement ring. Score!:)
