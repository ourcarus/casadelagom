## Food review for Rocky Tampines Cafe

We went for our first run at Tampines Hub level 5 today. Thought there weren't lockers available but turns out there were lockers. Ran 3 round of 700+m and 1 round of 400+m. 

Then we went to Rocky Tampines Cafe for brunch. Ordered the all-day american breakfast which paled in comparison to Kovan's all-day breakfast. Stitch ordered the baked chicken lasagne and regretted again at the end.
