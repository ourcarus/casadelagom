### Wedding Bands

We booked an appointment with JannPaul on 15th Apr 2022 (Good Friday), 4.30pm to browse the wedding bands but ended up placing a deposit given their high service standards and persuasiveness. Stitch was amazed at the JP staff's proactiveness in suggesting designs that compliments her engagement ring. Before the appointment, we went to Tiffany to view some wedding bands but there weren't many designs and service wasn't that good.
