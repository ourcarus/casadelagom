### Night cycling from ECP to Marina Barrage

We had our first night cycling together. We drove to ECP on Saturday, 25 Sep for an originally planned cycling and watching netflix at Marina Barrage before dinner. However we arrived at ECP around 6.30pm and decided to have dinner at East Coast Lagoon first.

We ordered bbq stingray, bbq chicken wings, sambal kangkong and a large sugarcane drink which we brought along during cycling.

We rented 2 bikes for 3 hours for $60 (avg $10/hr) and started cycling at 7.45pm. 15mins into cycling and Goofy realised we were headed in the wrong direction and turned back immediately after finishing the sugarcane drink and finding a place for it - a dustbin.

We took approximately another hour and reached Marina Barrage around 9.10pm, and rested there for about 20-30mins as we realised the entrance to the field area was closed. At least we managed to take some photos before cycling back. It was a good ride.
