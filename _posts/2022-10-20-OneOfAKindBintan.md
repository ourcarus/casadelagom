### One of A Kind Bintan birthday staycation

G and S took leave on 13-14 Oct 2022 for a 3D2N Bintan getaway staycation (Thurs-Sat) to celebrate S's birthday. Unknownst to S, G had arranged for room deco and a surprise birthday cake on 14 Oct night to be delivered to our room. We had also bought Rivals for Catan to play while we were at Bintan. It took a while to decide whether to try out One of a Kind Bintan resort or go back to The Residence Bintan where we visited in Dec 2019. In the end we decided to try out a new resort.

On Thurs 13 Oct, we headed to Changi City Point Song Fa Ba Kut Teh for lunch before taking the train and bus to Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal to catch our 2pm ferry to Bandar Bentan Telani (BBT) ferry terminal. We had a bit of delay at immigration as we forgot to bring a pen to fill up the Bintan immigration form (reminder next time to bring). We had arranged a driver from the resort to pick us up from BBT (IDR 450,000 approx. SGD 42 one way). The driver had been waiting and was prompt to fetch us to the resort.

#### Reaching the resort
We were greeted by a welcome drink and a birthday-decoed villa facing the ocean. After checking in, we took a quick bath and arranged for an in-room spa at 6pm (IDR 400,000 approx. SGD 37.50 per pax). After a minor awkward miscommunication with the therapists, we completed our 1 hour massage and headed to Teluk Bakau Bay View via our reception-booked taxi for our seafood dinner. Surprisingly, the driver was a 19 year old girl who wasn't very well verse in English but knows a bit of Malay. The meal was delicious. We had chilli crab, steamed prawns, kang kong and rica rica (chicken). At night, we read up the rules on Catan and started playing.

#### Birthday 14 Oct
We woke up at 8am for breakfast and then back to the room for a few more rounds of Catan. Then it started raining and we were stuck in the room for more Catan. We had lunch at the Azura restaurant and tried their Ayam Bakar, Ayam Penyet and satay. It was good. Afterwards, we were picked up by our driver at 3pm to head to River Spa. We boarded a sampan to the massage room which is in the woods, indeed a one-of-a-kind experience. After a 75min massage, we were provided 2 huge coconut drinks while we waited for our driver to pick us up to return to the resort. We headed for a 16-lap swim at the resort's pool before having dinner at the Ocean restaurant and ordered a sumptuous grilled fish, bok choy and some black pepper prawns. At around 9.30pm, the hotel staff sent a birthday cake with a lighted candle to our room but unfortunately S was in the bathroom. So G surprised S with the cake when she came out of the bathroom. Ate half the cake and ended the day with more Catan (expansion pack).

#### Final and departure day 15 Oct
We woke up at 5.30 to catch the lovely sunrise. The view was magnificent from our villa. After breakfast, we played some Catan, had a bath before checking out. We headed for lunch back at Teluk Bakau Bay View before heading to BBT to catch our ferry back to SG.
