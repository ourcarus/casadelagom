### Selected a unit at Tampines GreenOpal

After 2 unsuccessful tries (GreenGlen, GreenSpring), we managed to have a chance to select a flat in the Aug 2020 BTO application.

Results of our BTO application were out on 7 Sep 2020 and we opened the results together at Tampines MRT.

We were invited down to select a unit from the Aug 2020 BTO exercise. Our queue number was 1064/871. Our appointment date was 8 Dec 2020, 6pm. There were 100+ units left, mainly from GreenOpal.

There were a few factors to consider when selecting a unit: the layout of the unit, the "West Sun", the location of the unit along the corridor, level of the unit, if the unit was located near the highway/main road etc.

It was nerve-wrecking while waiting for our turn in the HDB hub lobby, hoping that the few couples before us will not pick the few units we have short-listed. It was finally our turn, and no one before us chose the unit we wanted yay!

We passed all the required documents to the lady officer that was serving us and signed many documents before we proceeded to pay $2000 option fee.

On hindsight, since we BTO-ed for the Aug 2020 BTO exercise, the income assessment is from Sept 2019 - Aug 2020. And R was still a student from Sept 2019 - Dec 2019, he was required to bring a proof of him being a student during that period.

GreenOpal is the only project that offered the OCS option compared to the other 2 projects which are PPVC projects. We opted in for OCS as it was the cheapest option at that point in time.
