### Wedding Preparations

It is the Hari Raya long weekend on 8-11 Jul 2022. 

### 11 Jul 2022
We went to Textile Center near Bugis to consult the Fengshui Master (about 1 hr). We didn't really understand most of the fengshui explanation but just the main part that there were some issues with our eight characters and the master struggled to give us 5 dates.

GDL - 1 week before
AC - Free and easy

### 24 Jul 2022
We went to MBS Singapore Wedding Fair. Despite us not planning to sign any packages, we ended up signing the 2nd bridal package that we saw - YC. The first bridal package we saw was Taiwanish and quite shady so it was a bit weird. We were drawn in and lost to YC's sales aunty and hence signed the package.

### 31 Jul 2022
We had our first appointment on 31 Jul 3.30pm at YC. Stitch tried on 8 dresses.

### 6 Aug 2022
1-Atico reached out to us to arrange an appointment for a site visit and also to let us know some of the bridal show perks during the bridal showcase on 14 Aug. We visited 1-Atico and saw a live wedding lunch ongoing. Unfortunately, our preferred date was booked already.

#### Collection of Wedding Bands
We finally collected our wedding bands at JP. Stitch paid the remanining balance using her new UOB Absolute Card as she was trying to hit 1.5k min spend to get the $150 cashback promo. There is one complimentary free polishing of ring which Amy advised us to use after 3 years. She also mentioned the possibility of future complimentary polishings on case basis (e.g. when she is around).

We visited P.S. Cafe at One Fullertone for solemnisation venue. The captain's room seems quite small compared to the photo itself. Apparently, the manager could only show us around and don't have the other detail. We'll need to take the discussion via email with P.S. Cafe.
