### Wedding Preparations

It is the Hari Raya long weekend on 8-11 Jul 2022. 

#### 11 Jul 2022
We went to Textile Center near Bugis to consult the Fengshui Master (about 1 hr). We didn't really understand most of the fengshui explanation but just the main part that there were some issues with our eight characters and the master struggled to give us 5 dates.

GDL - 1 week before
AC - Free and easy

#### 24 Jul 2022
#### MBS Singapore Wedding Fair
After attending the ID session with H & L, we went to MBS Singapore Wedding Fair. Despite us not planning to sign any packages, we ended up signing the 2nd bridal package that we saw - YC. The first bridal package we saw was Taiwanish and quite shady so it was a bit weird. We were drawn in and lost to YC's sales aunty and hence signed the bridal package.

#### Man Fu Yuan site visit for solemnisation
We visited Man Fu Yuan at Intercontinental Hotel at Bugis and the staff showed us the private dining room, enough to fit 4 tables and can collapse where necessary. The package is priced at $3,888+.

#### Secret Patio site visit for solemnisation
We visit Secret Patio at Tanjong Pagar and were greeted with no aircon. The space looks a bit run-down but seems to be quite cosy. $500/hr rental of space and min of 2hrs. 9-11am.

#### 31 Jul 2022
#### First appointment at YCBS
We had our first appointment on 31 Jul 3.30pm at YC. Stitch tried on 8 dresses.

#### 6 Aug 2022
#### 1-Atico site visit for lunch banquet
1-Atico reached out to us to arrange an appointment for a site visit and also to let us know some of the bridal show perks during the bridal showcase on 14 Aug. We visited 1-Atico and saw a live wedding lunch ongoing. Unfortunately, our preferred date was booked already.

#### Collection of Wedding Bands
We finally collected our wedding bands at JP. Stitch paid the remaining balance using her new UOB Absolute Card applied in Aug 2022 as she was trying to hit 1.5k min spend to get the $150 cashback promo. There is a complimentary free polishing of ring which Amy advised us to use after 3 years. She also mentioned the possibility of future complimentary polishings on case basis (e.g. when she is around).

#### P.S. Cafe at One Fullerton site visit for solemnisation
We visited P.S. Cafe at One Fullerton for solemnisation venue. The captain's room seems quite small compared to the photo itself. Apparently, the manager could only show us around and don't have the other detail. We'll need to take the discussion via email with P.S. Cafe.
