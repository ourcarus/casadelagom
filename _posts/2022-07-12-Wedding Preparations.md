### Wedding Preparations

It is the Hari Raya long weekend on 8-11 Jul 2022. 

### 11 Jul 2022
We went to Textile Center near Bugis to consult the Fengshui Master (about 1 hr). We didn't really understand most of the fengshui explanation but just the main part that there were some issues with our eight characters and the master struggled to give us 5 dates.

GDL - 1 week before
AC - Free and easy

### 24 Jul 2022
We went to MBS Singapore Wedding Fair. Despite us not planning to sign any packages, we ended up signing the 2nd bridal package that we saw - YC. The first bridal package we saw was Taiwanish and quite shady so it was a bit weird. We were drawn in and lost to YC's sales aunty and hence signed the package.

### 31 Jul 2022
We had our first appointment on 31 Jul 3.30pm at YC. Stitch tried on 8 dresses.
