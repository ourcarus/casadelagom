### Wedding Preparations

It is the Hari Raya long weekend on 8-11 Jul 2022. 

#### 11 Jul 2022 - Fengshui
We went to Textile Center near Bugis to consult the Fengshui Master (about 1 hr). We didn't really understand most of the fengshui explanation but just the main part that there were some issues with our eight characters and the master struggled to give us 5 dates.

GDL - 1 week before
AC - Free and easy

#### 24 Jul 2022 - MBS Singapore Wedding Fair
After attending the ID session with H & L, we went to MBS Singapore Wedding Fair. Despite us not planning to sign any packages, we ended up signing the 2nd bridal package that we saw - YC. The first bridal package we saw was Taiwanish and quite shady so it was a bit weird. We were drawn in and lost to YC's sales aunty and hence signed the bridal package.

#### 27 Jul 2022 - Man Fu Yuan site visit for solemnisation
We visited Man Fu Yuan at Intercontinental Hotel at Bugis and the staff showed us the private dining room, enough to fit 4 tables and can collapse where necessary. The package is priced at $3,888+.

#### Secret Patio site visit for solemnisation
We visit Secret Patio at Tanjong Pagar and were greeted with no aircon. The space looks a bit run-down but seems to be quite cosy. $500/hr rental of space and min of 2hrs. 9-11am.

#### 31 Jul 2022 First appointment at YCBS
We had our first appointment on 31 Jul 3.30pm at YC. Stitch tried on 8 dresses.

#### 6 Aug 2022 - 1-Atico site visit for lunch banquet
1-Atico reached out to us to arrange an appointment for a site visit and also to let us know some of the bridal show perks during the bridal showcase on 14 Aug. We visited 1-Atico and saw a live wedding lunch ongoing. Unfortunately, our preferred date was booked already.

#### Collection of Wedding Bands
We finally collected our wedding bands at JP. Stitch paid the remaining balance using her new UOB Absolute Card applied in Aug 2022 as she was trying to hit 1.5k min spend to get the $150 cashback promo. There is a complimentary free polishing of ring which Amy advised us to use after 3 years. She also mentioned the possibility of future complimentary polishings on case basis (e.g. when she is around).

#### P.S. Cafe at One Fullerton site visit for solemnisation
We visited P.S. Cafe at One Fullerton for solemnisation venue. The captain's room seems quite small compared to the photo itself. Apparently, the manager could only show us around and don't have the other detail. We'll need to take the discussion via email with P.S. Cafe.

#### 20 Aug 2022 - Sofitel Sentosa site visit
Off we start the day with a Blanco Court Prawn Mee brunch at Bugis. We parked at Bugis+ as it was quite hard to find a lot near the roadside during Saturday lunch hour. Then we headed to Ah Chew for dessert. Lucky we brought an umbrella as it rained.

Headed to Sentosa afterwards and met Praba from Sofitel. She didnt offer us water. Sofitel's package was at $1688++ with min 12 and max 14 tables. Stitch seem to be impressed by the ballroom which was what she was looking out for - an small and intimate venue. Praba told us that there is going to be an upcoming bridal showcase in Sep 2022 where there would be some additional perks offered. Afterwards, we lazed at Vivo, ate dinner and sent Stitch to class.

#### 21 Aug 2022 - Hilton, Sheraton and Furama Riverfront site visits

Started the day by sending Stitch to class and then fetched H and L from Woodlands to meet S for lunch after class. Famous Shanghai Renjia restaurant in AMK that we wanted to go to was full for lunch and we didn't 
know that it required a booking.

##### Hilton
Met J at Hilton where she brought us to see the Tea Room and the Imperial Ballroom at level 35. It was quite strange that she brought us for site visit even while some painting works are being done in the ballroom. She also did not close the curtains for us to view the lightings. The ballroom layout is one-of-a-kind theatre style which is very unique. J mentioned that a couple was also looking at our same date for lunch and was already ready to place a deposit and that we will need to make a decision on the same day. We tried to negotiate for perks and L helped us to get additional 10 wines and waiver of corkage.

#### Sheraton
Ballroom(s), especially Topaz Ballroom (max 144) has old vibes and it is a bit special that Sheraton offers 12 pax per table. Bad thing is that Topaz room has a pillar which causes some guests to be out of sight from the stage. Good thing is that Sheraton was quite generous and gave us some pastries to bring home. We also found out more about a live band vendor.

#### Furama Riverfront
The waterfall (min 15 tables) venue that we wanted is actually a lounge area turned wedding venue. However, it is already taken on our date and time. Other ballrooms didn't seem that appealing although the package was one of the most value package we've come across.

#### 28 Aug 2022 - M Hotel, Fullerton Hotel and Fullerton Bay Hotel site visits

##### M Hotel 4pm
Fetched Stitch after class to M Hotel where we met H, L, M who had already viewed the venues at M. The package was quite value for money (with complimentary free flow beer, wine and additional night stay if we confirm on the day) and room seems to be quite nice. However, stage looks filmsy and the ceiling is quite short. Ballroom doesn't seem that nice compared to others.

##### Fullerton Hotel
Met hotel sales person W at Fullerton where she brought us to view the Straits Room (Level 4, min 100, max 140. We were surprised to find out that Straits Room is going to be renovated sometime in 2023 and estimated to be completed around mid-Sep, far too close to our wedding date. Furthermore, Straits Room, the toilet and the Rooftop (for pre-event cocktails) are not wheelchair friendly. Price per table: $1,928 per table.

##### Fullerton Bay Hotel
W brought us to view Fullerton Bay Hotel where the main selling point is the views but the venue is kind of visible to the public. Min spend is $40k and the rate is $278pp.
