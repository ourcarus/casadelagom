### Wedding Preparations

It is the Hari Raya long weekend on 8-11 Jul 2022. 

#### 11 Jul 2022 - Fengshui
We went to Textile Center near Bugis to consult the Fengshui Master (about 1 hr). We didn't really understand most of the fengshui explanation but just the main part that there were some issues with our eight characters and the master struggled to give us 5 dates.

GDL - 1 week before
AC - Free and easy

#### 24 Jul 2022 - MBS Singapore Wedding Fair
After attending the ID session with H & L, we went to MBS Singapore Wedding Fair. Despite us not planning to sign any packages, we ended up signing the 2nd bridal package that we saw - YC. The first bridal package we saw was Taiwanish and quite shady so it was a bit weird. We were drawn in and lost to YC's sales aunty and hence signed the bridal package.

#### 27 Jul 2022 - Man Fu Yuan site visit for solemnisation
We visited Man Fu Yuan at Intercontinental Hotel at Bugis and the staff showed us the private dining room, enough to fit 4 tables and can collapse where necessary. The package is priced at $3,888+.

#### Secret Patio site visit for solemnisation
We visit Secret Patio at Tanjong Pagar and were greeted with no aircon. The space looks a bit run-down but seems to be quite cosy. $500/hr rental of space and min of 2hrs. 9-11am.

#### 31 Jul 2022 First appointment at YCBS
We had our first appointment on 31 Jul 3.30pm at YC. Stitch tried on 8 dresses.

#### 6 Aug 2022 - 1-Atico site visit for lunch banquet
1-Atico reached out to us to arrange an appointment for a site visit and also to let us know some of the bridal show perks during the bridal showcase on 14 Aug. We visited 1-Atico and saw a live wedding lunch ongoing. Unfortunately, our preferred date was booked already.

#### Collection of Wedding Bands
We finally collected our wedding bands at JP. Stitch paid the remaining balance using her new UOB Absolute Card applied in Aug 2022 as she was trying to hit 1.5k min spend to get the $150 cashback promo. There is a complimentary free polishing of ring which Amy advised us to use after 3 years. She also mentioned the possibility of future complimentary polishings on case basis (e.g. when she is around).

#### P.S. Cafe at One Fullerton site visit for solemnisation
We visited P.S. Cafe at One Fullerton for solemnisation venue. The captain's room seems quite small compared to the photo itself. Apparently, the manager could only show us around and don't have the other detail. We'll need to take the discussion via email with P.S. Cafe.

#### 20 Aug 2022 - Sofitel Sentosa site visit
Off we start the day with a Blanco Court Prawn Mee brunch at Bugis. We parked at Bugis+ as it was quite hard to find a lot near the roadside during Saturday lunch hour. Then we headed to Ah Chew for dessert. Lucky we brought an umbrella as it rained.

Headed to Sentosa afterwards and met Praba from Sofitel. She didnt offer us water. Sofitel's package was at $1688++ with min 12 and max 14 tables. Stitch seem to be impressed by the ballroom which was what she was looking out for - an small and intimate venue. Praba told us that there is going to be an upcoming bridal showcase in Sep 2022 where there would be some additional perks offered. Afterwards, we lazed at Vivo, ate dinner and sent Stitch to class.

#### 21 Aug 2022 - Hilton, Sheraton and Furama Riverfront site visits

Started the day by sending Stitch to class and then fetched H and L from Woodlands to meet S for lunch after class. Famous Shanghai Renjia restaurant in AMK that we wanted to go to was full for lunch and we didn't 
know that it required a booking.

##### Hilton
Met J at Hilton where she brought us to see the Tea Room and the Imperial Ballroom at level 35. It was quite strange that she brought us for site visit even while some painting works are being done in the ballroom. She also did not close the curtains for us to view the lightings. The ballroom layout is one-of-a-kind theatre style which is very unique. J mentioned that a couple was also looking at our same date for lunch and was already ready to place a deposit and that we will need to make a decision on the same day. We tried to negotiate for perks and L helped us to get additional 10 wines and waiver of corkage.

#### Sheraton
Ballroom(s), especially Topaz Ballroom (max 144) has old vibes and it is a bit special that Sheraton offers 12 pax per table. Bad thing is that Topaz room has a pillar which causes some guests to be out of sight from the stage. Good thing is that Sheraton was quite generous and gave us some pastries to bring home. We also found out more about a live band vendor.

#### Furama Riverfront
The waterfall (min 15 tables) venue that we wanted is actually a lounge area turned wedding venue. However, it is already taken on our date and time. Other ballrooms didn't seem that appealing although the package was one of the most value package we've come across.

#### 28 Aug 2022 - M Hotel, Fullerton Hotel and Fullerton Bay Hotel site visits

##### M Hotel 4pm
Fetched Stitch after class to M Hotel where we met H, L, M who had already viewed the venues at M. The package was quite value for money (with complimentary free flow beer, wine and additional night stay if we confirm on the day) and room seems to be quite nice. However, stage looks filmsy and the ceiling is quite short. Ballroom doesn't seem that nice compared to others.

##### Fullerton Hotel
Met hotel sales person W at Fullerton where she brought us to view the Straits Room (Level 4, min 100, max 140. We were surprised to find out that Straits Room is going to be renovated sometime in 2023 and estimated to be completed around mid-Sep, far too close to our wedding date. Furthermore, Straits Room, the toilet and the Rooftop (for pre-event cocktails) are not wheelchair friendly. Price per table: $1,928 per table.

##### Fullerton Bay Hotel
W brought us to view Fullerton Bay Hotel where the main selling point is the views but the venue is kind of visible to the public. Min spend is $40k and the rate is $278pp.

#### 17 Sep 2022 - Sofitel Sentosa Wedding Showcase and Deposit
6 of us went down to Sentosa and we met P at Sofitel but she showed us the deco at the straits ballroom instead of the saffron ballroom that we were looking for. Since we already discussed about the package via email, P briefed us the final package inclusions before we signed the draft contract and paid the $5k deposit via grabpay (split into 2x $2.5k payments). The grab wallet then reached to 80/90% of the $30k limit. Beer barrel was 20L and additional barrel is $500. Then we had L and H drop us off for a short visit to C's graduation at Grand Copthorne Hotel before we headed home.

#### 17 Oct 2022 - Confirmation and signing of contract
After clarifications with P via email, we signed the official contract and sent it back to Sofitel.

#### 27 Nov 2022 - Second appointment at YCBS
C went down to try 13 more gowns together with her sis.

#### 26 Dec 2022 - Third appointment at YCBS
We went down to finalise gown selection and try on suits. Also decided on the details and design of the custom made gown and selected the photographer.

#### 5 Feb 2023 - SDJ at Chow Tai Fook
After yuan xiao lunch with Serangoon family at Jewel, we went to browse SDJ at Chow Tai Fook and ended up getting a set of 5 jewellery.

#### 12 Feb 2023 - TQ at Soup Restaurant, Jewel
2 families finally met for the first official meal at Soup restaurant Jewel for TQ.

#### 19 Mar 2023 - Fitting for pre-wedding shoot
We went down to YCBS on Sunday for final fitting before the actual shoot next Monday.

#### 27 Mar 2023 - Fourth appointment at YCBS: Actual pre-wedding shoot
We had Yakun for bf together with L at century square before heading to YCBS for makeup at 9.30am. It started raining on the way to AMK.

A came along with mcdonalds brunch around 11am. By 12.30pm we were almost done with makeup and started to head to our first location Seletar Reservoir for the huge tree, while it was still raining. We started with casual outfits (navy top, khaki pants, navy maxi dress) and began moving into poses as directed by photographer Coffee. We had to find cover under trees so as not to get our makeup wet.

Next we changed to our gowns and suits and thankfully the weather started to clear up and we continued with the shoot. After we were done, we changed into the second gown and left for Henderson Waves around 3.20pm. L and A dropped us off at the entrance of Henderson Waves before parking the car. We spent about 2hrs+ taking photos before we headed to our final location MBS 6+pm (parked at Ritz Carlton as the carpark charges were $2 plus per entry after 6pm). We changed into final purple gown and navy suit and walked across Helix Bridge to LV for some photos. Then we walked back to Helix Bridge for some iconic MBS night shots and ended around 8.20pm.

#### 20 May 2023 - Fifth appointment at YCBS: Selection of photos
We booked an appointment on Sat 2pm to select our 40 pre-wedding photos. Reached late about 2.30pm because we queued for Ubi fish soup for lunch.

#### 21 May 2023 - Solemnisation at Kai Garden
We reached Kai Garden around 11.30am before our solemniser arrived. We were pleasantly surprised by the nice complimentary ROM table decoration but then realised it was probably a reuse as we heard from the main waitress that a couple had their solemnisation the previous day in the same room. Mum gave the waitress an angbao after the last course of the meal even though she told me it wasn't required when i asked her in the morning.

We chose to have a simple solemnisation (without march-in) and read to each other our personal wedding vows. Thought our solemniser was going to summarise our personal vows in Chinese, but no. After solemnisation, we headed to Funan to take some photos at Photomatic but was told that the earliest available slot is only at 6.45pm. So, we headed to check-in at Fort Canning Hotel first before leaving the hotel to go back for the photoshoot and dinner at a mexican-indian restaurant at Clarke Quay.

#### 22 May 2023 - High Tea at Ritz Carlton and Fast X movie at City Square
Unfortunately, there were no more slots at the Fort Canning Hotel's spa. We ate So Good at Capitol at 1pm, before heading to Orchard to send our wedding bands for engraving. Then we headed to Ritz Carlton for high tea at 3.30pm where we ate until we were bloated. Then we headed to City Square to catch the Fast X movie, our first experience at GV Gemini.

#### 25 May 2023 - Collection of wedding bands after engraving
Went to Orchard to collect our wedding bands after engraving.

#### 28 May 2023 - Celebration dinner with aunts
We had celebratory dinner at Hua Yu Wee Seafood Restaurant with the aunts and families and also Kooks Creamery at Bedok for dessert.

#### 1 Jul 2023 - Sixth appointment at YCBS: Confirmation of album layout, 5-in-1 frame and cover photo
We had usual fish soup at Tai Seng before heading down to YCBS at 2pm to confirm the album layouts. We finally received our unedited and edited 40 soft copies of our pre-wedding photos, along with the album layouts, in a YCBS thumbdrive. S was so happy.

#### 13 Aug 2023 - GDL
I woke up at at 7.45am and the roast pig (10kg but larger than expected) arrived at Tampines house just after i finished bathing, around 8am. The wedding cakes arrived sometime after, before 9am. AC and J arrived around 9.15am, accompanied by Ahma whom i was surprised to see. We waited for L and H to arrive around 10am and then we began our journey sometime around 10.30am. I helped to hang the hongcai and we took some photos of the GDL stuff. Afterwards we delivered the wedding cakes to Serangoon and Tampines.

#### 10 Sep 2023 - Seventh appointment at YCBS: Final fitting
We had a 6pm appointment at YCBS for the final fitting. It was done quickly and had minor alterations.

#### 15 - 18 Sep 2023 - Check-in to Sofitel and Actual Wedding
We took leave on 15 Sep, so 14 Sep (Thursday) was our last working day of the week. On 14 Sep, we met at city hall to get the lush bubble bar before heading home.

Our wedding coordinator granted us early check-in at 1pm for 3 out of the 8 rooms that we booked. However, when i arrived with my parents at 1pm, reception said that cleaning is still ongoing for our rooms and we are unable to check-in at the moment. We waited for sometime before they gave us a key for 1 room (but it was the Bride's room and she was not even here yet). Eventually, we only managed to check-in to our correct rooms at 3pm. At 5pm, we went to YCBS to collect the remaining 2 groom suits, sister's gown, fresh flowers, corsages, and for the bridal car decoration. I also found it strange that groom's makeup is not included in the bridal package that we signed. While waiting for the car deco, we had western dinner at the coffeeshop downstairs.

We had a walk to Saffron Ballroom at 9pm+, just to check out the venue, and were shocked to see another wedding couple's table arrangement which was for 16 Sep, although the guest list at the reception table still remain ours. Many possible explanations ran through our head and we still couldn't figure out why, so we asked our WC. Our WC replied that there is indeed a wedding before ours on 16 Sep, leaving us even more puzzled.

We continued with the wedding planning after we reached back the hotel and then with the shu tou ceremony at 11.15pm (delayed from 11pm) with us video-calling each other and lasting for just a few mins with our family around us. C sneaked in with me after everything ended, close to about 1am, and i was glad we managed to sleep through together, before she headed back around 5am for her makeup the next day.

#### Actual Wedding 16 Sep
Makeup for the bride was supposed to start at 6am but the MUA was late. Other MUAs arrived before the bride's MUA. Parents' makeup started from 5am/7am.

I also wokeup at 5am+, took a shower and got dressed. Photographer R arrived around 7am+ and started work. I was waiting for 7.40am for J to reach so that he can open the car door but had some slight delay as apparently they took the wrong turn and went to the RWS carpark instead. Nearing 8am, we successfully completed the car door and went back to my room to wait for the bride's makeup to be completed. When fetching the bride, i was greeted with a room full of cousins and relatives and i believe everyone was very happy and emotional at that moment. Exchanged YYZE, DLJLJ and another angbao with my parents-in-law and we fed each other cheng tng soup. Hopped into the bridal car, and we drove 1 roundabout and returned to the hotel, with Tampines grandma also observing the process. We went back to my room where my parents await and fed each other tangyuan (without fillings). Then we headed to the bridal changing room where we start to have the tea ceremonies.

In between tea ceremonies, we had phototakings as expected. Nearing 11.15am, more guests started arriving and the BM asked if they should start serving the cocktails. While i gave the go-ahead, i wasn't aware that the banquet wines would also be served during the cocktails. I was unpleasantly surprised to be informed that the 14 banquet wines had been emptied even before the banquet had started. Once 11.45am hit, most guests had arrived and the doors were open for guests to enter. The doors closed at 12.15pm to play the wedding montage and for the first and only march-in, followed by cake-cutting. After the 4th dish, we had champagne pouring and thank you speeches. Then emcees surprised us with fly me to the moon song which went quite well i felt. When the banquet ended, we headed outside for more photos before we check-in to our bridal suite and called it a day.
