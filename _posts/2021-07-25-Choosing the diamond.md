##Choosing the diamond

After much discussion and consideration, C has decided to go with the lab grown Decagon diamond from JP. However, the lab grown diamonds from JP starts at 0.5 carat weight. After sending an enquiry email to JP staff (Dylan) who attended to us during our first visit to JP, the price range of a 0.51-0.55 carat lab grown Decagon diamond is about $2000 - $2200.

We wanted to make an appointment for our second visit to JP at the end of July. Unfortunately, SG has went back to Phase 2 Heightened Alert where we are unable to dine out. Hence, we decided to push back our appointment to after SG has relaxed its rules slightly (ie. to be able to dine out), which is tentatively after 18 August 2021.
