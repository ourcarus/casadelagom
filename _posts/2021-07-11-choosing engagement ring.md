## Choosing engagement ring

Last week (3rd Jul 2021, Saturday), we booked an appointment with Jann Paul to view the diamond engagement rings. We had a 2.5hr session learning about diamonds and the 4Cs, Cut, Colour, Clarity and Carat. Jann Paul has a signature 10 hearts and arrows diamond, shaped in decagon. Jann Paul is just beginning their lab grown diamonds hunt.

A sample 0.43 CT VVS1 D diamond cost about $3k. Ring setting with side diamonds was $1k+.

This week (10 Jul 2021, Saturday), we booked an appointment with Michael Trio at Tanjong Pagar. Session was about 1.5hr long and was more focused on the ring setting rather than the diamond.

Before the appointment, we went to Vivo diamonds.
