### Signing HDB AFL and food review

Stitch accompanied Goofy to dental appointment on 6 Nov and had pancakes, breakfast platter and ice cream.

We had pancakes at Belle-Ville at Novena Velocity and it was good.

Afterwards, we headed to Craftsmen Specialty Coffee to have some late brunch with Stitch's favourite valrhona iced chocolate drink.
