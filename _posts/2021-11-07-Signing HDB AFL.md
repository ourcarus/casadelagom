### Signing HDB AFL and food review

Stitch accompanied Goofy to dental appointment on 6 Nov and had pancakes, breakfast platter and ice cream.

We had pancakes at Belle-Ville at Novena Velocity and it was good.

Afterwards, we headed to Craftsmen Specialty Coffee to have some late brunch with Stitch's favourite valrhona iced chocolate drink.

On 7 Nov 2021, we took 28 from bedok to toa payoh to eat Chef Kang Noodle House wanton mee. It was good and worth the rain we made through.

Afterwards, we went to HDB hub to sign the AFL. The HDB officer informed us that the lease will begin in Nov 2026 regardless of the date of key collection which will be a slight advantage to us if we manage to collect the keys early whereas the MOP will start from date of key collection.
