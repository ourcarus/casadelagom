## Change of OCS

After much discussion we decide to email HDB to request for change of the OCS option, to not have all the internal doors, sanitary fittings, and floor finishes provided in the flat.

We took a full day leave from work and travelled to HDB on 16 Apr 2021, 10.30am to sign the change of OCS option and it was done in 10 mins. Fast game.
