### Tailored Jeans at ThreeButtons

On 3 Sep 2022, we went to explore ThreeButtons for a tailor made jeans and was quoted either $250 for Kuroki jeans or $300 for Japan Blue jeans which is supposedly of a higher quality. Went for the Japan Blue jeans for a better quality and paid via Pace app which had a $10 discount coupon, so end up paid $290 for the jeans.

#### First fitting on 30 Sep 2022
Booked an appointment on 30 Sep 2022, Friday 7.15pm for the first fitting. Changed to thread colour from loud rose gold to dark brown, which is softer.
