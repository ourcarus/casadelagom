### Tailored Jeans at ThreeButtons

On 3 Sep 2022, we went to explore ThreeButtons for a tailor made jeans and was quoted either $250 for Kuroki jeans or $300 for Japan Blue jeans which is supposedly of a higher quality. Went for the Japan Blue jeans for a better quality and paid via Pace app which had a $10 discount coupon, so end up paid $290 for the jeans.

Booked a second appointment on 30 Sep 2022, Friday 7.15pm for the first fitting. Changed to thread colour from loud rose gold to dark brown, which is softer.
